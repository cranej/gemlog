# Quick fixes...or "fixes"?

## 2023-08-14
* Struggled for a while but still can't make emoji works on urxvt. Switched to st[1], everything just works out of box. Problem solved.
* Gemini client amfora[2] keeps showing strange characters, and can't show some preformatted text correctly. Export LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8, problem solved.
